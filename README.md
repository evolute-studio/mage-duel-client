# **Running the Project**

To run the client, follow simple steps:

1. Open the scene `Assets/Scenes/Start.scene`
2. Find the game object: `WorldManager`.
3. In the `WorldManager` and `DojoGameManager` components, set the connection configuration in the `Dojo Config` field. An example of configurations can be found here: `Assets/TerritoryWars/DojoConfig/`.
4. Set the address for the `Game` and `Player_profile_actions` contracts

# **Building the Project**
To build, you need to select the target platform **WebGL**:

1. Select the platform as a target in `Build Profiles`
2. Select the `Dojo` template in `PlayerSettings` (a fix has been added to the template to solve the problem with the inability to create a Burner Account after page overload)
3. Build the project
4. In the folder with the finished build, there will be a simple python web server `unity_server.py`
